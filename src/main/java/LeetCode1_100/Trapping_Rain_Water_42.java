 * iven n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 *
 *
 * The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!
